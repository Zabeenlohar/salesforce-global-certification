#### üîπ Get Started with Apex Triggers
**What I Learned:**
- How to write triggers that execute actions **before or after DML events** like insert, update, delete, and undelete.  
- Understood **trigger syntax** and important **context variables**:
  - `Trigger.new`, `Trigger.old`, `Trigger.isInsert`, `Trigger.isUpdate`, etc.  
- Practiced creating a simple trigger: `HelloWorldTrigger` for the `Account` object.  
- Learned trigger use cases:
  - Automatically creating related **Opportunity** records for new Accounts.  
  - Sending **custom notifications** after record creation.  
  - Preventing **Account deletion** if related Opportunities exist.  
  - Performing **asynchronous callouts** using `@future(callout=true)` methods.  

---

#### üîπ Bulk Apex Triggers
**What I Learned:**
- Importance of **bulkifying triggers** to handle large data volumes efficiently.  
- Salesforce processes triggers in **batches of 200 records**, so optimization is crucial.  
- Best practices learned:
  - ‚ùå Avoid SOQL/DML inside `for` loops.  
  - ‚úÖ Use **collections** (`Lists`, `Maps`, `Sets`) to perform operations on multiple records.  
- Practiced examples:
  - Using `WHERE Id IN :Trigger.new` in SOQL queries.  
  - Performing DML operations on collections instead of single records.  
- Enhanced previous triggers (`AddRelatedRecord`, `SoqlTriggerBulk`, `DmlTriggerBulk`) to make them **bulk-safe**.  

---

#### üí° Key Takeaways:
- Always **bulkify triggers** to avoid hitting governor limits.  
- Keep business logic in **helper classes** for cleaner, reusable code.  
- Use **context variables** smartly to handle multiple trigger events.  
- Handle exceptions with `addError()` for better data integrity.  

---

#### üß© Skills Gained:
- Writing and optimizing Apex Triggers.  
- Using SOQL and DML effectively inside triggers.  
- Understanding Salesforce **trigger lifecycle** and **best practices**.  
- Building efficient, scalable automation logic.  

---

**Reflection:**  
Today‚Äôs module was really insightful! I learned how triggers automate business logic and how important it is to keep them efficient. Excited to move on to more complex Apex topics üíª‚ö°
